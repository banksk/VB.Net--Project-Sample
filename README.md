This is sample code from one of my projects utilizing VB.net. The project is a basic burger restaurant app that takes customer orders and then calculates the total.

CalcOrder.vb calculates the selected items

frmBurgers.vb allows the user to select burgers

frmDrinks.vb allows the user to select drinks

frmSides.vb allows the user to select sides

frmMain.vb displays the selected items and the calculated totals
